# Human-Health-Monitoring-Syetem----By-using-Arduino
IoT-based Human Health Monitoring System ❤️ | Built with Arduino Uno and MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter Sensor to monitor heart rate and SpO₂ levels in real-time, displaying results on a 16x2 I²C LCD. Uses Arduino IDE and Python for data handling. This project was built during my third year of graduation (Semester III).
